This repository publishes three different NPM modules: swagger-ui is a traditional npm module intended for use in single-page applications that are capable of resolving dependencies (via Webpack, Browserify, etc.). swagger-ui-dist is a dependency-free module that includes everything you need to serve Swagger UI in a server-side project, or a single-page application that can't resolve npm module dependencies. swagger-ui-react is Swagger UI packaged as a React component for use in React applications. We strongly suggest that you use swagger-ui instead of swagger-ui-dist if you're building a single-page application, since swagger-ui-dist is significantly larger.

If you aren't already familiar, here's some suggested reading: React: Quick Start (reactjs.org) Redux README (redux.js.org) In the following documentation, we won't take the time to define the fundamentals covered in the resources above. Note : Some of the examples in this section contain JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript that is useful for writing React components. If you don't want to set up a build pipeline capable of translating JSX to JavaScript, take a look at React without JSX (reactjs.org) . You can use our system.React reference to leverage React without needing to pull a copy into your project. The System The system is the heart of the Swagger UI application. At runtime, it's a JavaScript object that holds many things: React components Bound Redux actions and reducers Bound Reselect state selectors System-wide collection of available components Built-in helpers like getComponent , makeMappedContainer , and getStore References to the React and Immutable.js libraries ( system.React , system.Im ) User-defined helper functions The system is built up when Swagger UI is called by iterating through (\"compiling\") each plugin that Swagger UI has been given, through the presets and plugins configuration options. Presets Presets are arrays of plugins, which are provided to Swagger UI through the presets configuration option. All plugins within presets are compiled before any plugins provided via the plugins configuration option. Consider the following example: const MyPreset = [FirstPlugin, SecondPlugin, ThirdPlugin] SwaggerUI({ presets: [ MyPreset ] }) By default, Swagger UI includes the internal ApisPreset , which contains a set of plugins that provide baseline functionality for Swagger UI. If you specify your own presets option, you need to add the ApisPreset manually, like so: SwaggerUI({ presets: [ SwaggerUI.presets.apis, MyAmazingCustomPreset ] }) The need to provide the apis preset when adding other presets is an artifact of Swagger UI's original design, and will likely be removed in the next major version. getComponent getComponent is a helper function injected into every container component, which is used to get references to components provided by the plugin system. All components should be loaded through getComponent , since it allows other plugins to modify the component. It is preferred over a conventional import statement. Container components in Swagger UI can be loaded by passing true as the second argument to getComponent , like so: getComponent(\"ContainerComponentName\", true) This will map the current system as props to the component.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"swagger/swagger-ui-master/swagger-ui-master/docs/customization/overview/#plugin-system-overview","text":"","title":"Plugin system overview"},{"location":"swagger/swagger-ui-master/swagger-ui-master/docs/customization/overview/#prior-art","text":"Swagger UI leans heavily on concepts and patterns found in React and Redux.

If you specify your own presets option, you need to add the ApisPreset manually, like so: SwaggerUI({ presets: [ SwaggerUI.presets.apis, MyAmazingCustomPreset ] }) The need to provide the apis preset when adding other presets is an artifact of Swagger UI's original design, and will likely be removed in the next major version.","title":"Presets"},{"location":"swagger/swagger-ui-master/swagger-ui-master/docs/customization/overview/#getcomponent","text":"getComponent is a helper function injected into every container component, which is used to get references to components provided by the plugin system.

Often, it is beneficial to override the core internals to achieve custom behavior. Note: Semantic Versioning Swagger UI's internal APIs are not part of our public contract, which means that they can change without the major version change. If your custom plugins wrap, extend, override, or consume any internal core APIs, we recommend specifying a specific minor version of Swagger UI to use in your application, because they will not change between patch versions. If you're installing Swagger UI via NPM, for example, you can do this by using a tilde: { \"dependencies\": { \"swagger-ui\": \"~3.11.0\" } } fn.opsFilter When using the filter option, tag names will be filtered by the user-provided value. If you'd like to customize this behavior, you can override the default opsFilter function. For example, you can implement a multiple-phrase filter: const MultiplePhraseFilterPlugin = function() { return { fn: { opsFilter: (taggedOps, phrase) => { const phrases = phrase.split(\", \") return taggedOps.filter((val, key) => { return phrases.some(item => key.indexOf(item) > -1) }) } } } } Logo component While using the Standalone Preset the SwaggerUI logo is rendered in the Top Bar. The logo can be exchanged by replacing the Logo component via the plugin api: import React from \"react\"; const MyLogoPlugin = { components: { Logo: () => ( <img alt=\"My Logo\" height=\"40\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,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\"/> ) } } JSON Schema components In swagger there are so called JSON Schema components. These are used to render inputs for parameters and components of request bodies with application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/* media-type. Internally swagger uses following mapping to find the JSON Schema component from OpenAPI Specification schema information: For each schema\u2019s type(eg. string , array , \u2026) and if defined schema\u2019s format (eg. \u2018date\u2019, \u2018uuid\u2019, \u2026) there is a corresponding component mapping: If format defined: `JsonSchema_${type}_${format}` Fallback if JsonSchema_${type}_${format} component does not exist or format not defined: `JsonSchema_${type}` Default: `JsonSchema_string` With this, one can define custom input components or override existing. Example Date-Picker plugin If one would like to input date values you could provide a custom plugin to integrate react-datepicker into swagger-ui. All you need to do is to create a component to wrap react-datepicker accordingly to the format. There are two cases: - yaml type: string format: date The resulting name for mapping to succeed: JsonSchema_string_date - yaml type: string format: date-time The resulting name for mapping to succeed: JsonSchema_string_date-time This creates the need for two components and simple logic to strip any time input in case the format is date: import React from \"react\"; import DatePicker from \"react-datepicker\"; import \"react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css\"; const JsonSchema_string_date = (props) => { const dateNumber = Date.parse(props.value); const date = dateNumber ? new Date(dateNumber) : new Date(); return ( <DatePicker selected={date} onChange={d => props.onChange(d.toISOString().substring(0, 10))} /> ); } const JsonSchema_string_date_time = (props) => { const dateNumber = Date.parse(props.value); const date = dateNumber ? new Date(dateNumber) : new Date(); return ( <DatePicker selected={date} onChange={d => props.onChange(d.toISOString())} showTimeSelect timeFormat=\"p\" dateFormat=\"Pp\" /> ); } export const DateTimeSwaggerPlugin = { components: { JsonSchema_string_date: JsonSchema_string_date, \"JsonSchema_string_date-time\": JsonSchema_string_date_time } }; Request Snippets SwaggerUI can be configured with the requestSnippetsEnabled: true option to activate Request Snippets. Instead of the generic curl that is generated upon doing a request. It gives you more granular options: - curl for bash - curl for cmd - curl for powershell There might be the case where you want to provide your own snipped generator. This can be done by using the plugin api. A Request Snipped generator consists of the configuration and a fn , which takes the internal request object and transforms it to the desired snippet. // Add config to Request Snippets Configuration with an unique key like \"node_native\" const snippetConfig = { requestSnippetsEnabled: true, requestSnippets: { generators: { \"node_native\": { title: \"NodeJs Native\", syntax: \"javascript\" } } } } const SnippedGeneratorNodeJsPlugin = { fn: { // use `requestSnippetGenerator_` + key from config (node_native) for generator fn requestSnippetGenerator_node_native: (request) => { const url = new Url(request.get(\"url\")) let isMultipartFormDataRequest = false const headers = request.get(\"headers\") if(headers && headers.size) { request.get(\"headers\").map((val, key) => { isMultipartFormDataRequest = isMultipartFormDataRequest || /^content-type$/i.test(key) && /^multipart\\/form-data$/i.test(val) }) } const packageStr = url.protocol === \"https:\" ? \"https\" : \"http\" let reqBody = request.get(\"body\") if (request.get(\"body\")) { if (isMultipartFormDataRequest && [\"POST\", \"PUT\", \"PATCH\"].includes(request.get(\"method\"))) { return \"throw new Error(\\\"Currently unsupported content-type: /^multipart\\\\/form-data$/i\\\");\" } else { if (!Map.isMap(reqBody)) { if (typeof reqBody !== \"string\") { reqBody = JSON.stringify(reqBody) } } else { reqBody = getStringBodyOfMap(request) } } } else if (!request.get(\"body\") && request.get(\"method\") === \"POST\") { reqBody = \"\" } const stringBody = \"`\" + (reqBody || \"\") .replace(/\\\\n/g, \"\\n\") .replace(/`/g, \"\\\\`\") + \"`\" return `const http = require(\"${packageStr}\"); const options = { \"method\": \"${request.get(\"method\")}\", \"hostname\": \"${url.host}\", \"port\": ${url.port || \"null\"}, \"path\": \"${url.pathname}\"${headers && headers.size ? `, \"headers\": { ${request.get(\"headers\").map((val, key) => `\"${key}\": \"${val}\"`).valueSeq().join(\",\\n \")} }` : \"\"} }; const req = http.request(options, function (res) { const chunks = []; res.on(\"data\", function (chunk) { chunks.push(chunk); }); res.on(\"end\", function () { const body = Buffer.concat(chunks); console.log(body.toString()); }); }); ${reqBody ? `\\nreq.write(${stringBody});` : \"\"} req.end();` } } } const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({ \"dom_id\": \"#swagger-ui\", deepLinking: true, presets: [ SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis, SwaggerUIStandalonePreset ], plugins: [ SwaggerUIBundle.plugins.DownloadUrl, SnippedGeneratorNodeJsPlugin ], layout: \"StandaloneLayout\", validatorUrl: \"https://validator.swagger.io/validator\", url: \"https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json\", ...snippetConfig, }) Error handling SwaggerUI comes with a safe-render plugin that handles error handling allows plugging into error handling system and modify it. The plugin accepts a list of component names that should be protected by error boundaries. Its public API looks like this: { fn: { componentDidCatch, withErrorBoundary: withErrorBoundary(getSystem), }, components: { ErrorBoundary, Fallback, }, } safe-render plugin is automatically utilized by base and standalone SwaggerUI presets and should always be used as the last plugin, after all the components are already known to the SwaggerUI. The plugin defines a default list of components that should be protected by error boundaries: [ \"App\", \"BaseLayout\", \"VersionPragmaFilter\", \"InfoContainer\", \"ServersContainer\", \"SchemesContainer\", \"AuthorizeBtnContainer\", \"FilterContainer\", \"Operations\", \"OperationContainer\", \"parameters\", \"responses\", \"OperationServers\", \"Models\", \"ModelWrapper\", \"Topbar\", \"StandaloneLayout\", \"onlineValidatorBadge\" ] As demonstrated below, additional components can be protected by utilizing the safe-render plugin with configuration options. This gets really handy if you are a SwaggerUI integrator and you maintain a number of plugins with additional custom components. const swaggerUI = SwaggerUI({ url: \"https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json\", dom_id: '#swagger-ui', plugins: [ () => ({ components: { MyCustomComponent1: () => 'my custom component', }, }), SwaggerUI.plugins.SafeRender({ fullOverride: true, // only the component list defined here will apply (not the default list) componentList: [ \"MyCustomComponent1\", ], }), ], }); componentDidCatch This static function is invoked after a component has thrown an error. It receives two parameters: error - The error that was thrown. info - An object with a componentStack key containing information about which component threw the error . It has precisely the same signature as error boundaries componentDidCatch lifecycle method , except it's a static function and not a class method. Default implement of componentDidCatch uses console.error to display the received error: export const componentDidCatch = console.error; To utilize your own error handling logic (e.g. bugsnag ), create new SwaggerUI plugin that overrides componentDidCatch: {% highlight js linenos %} const BugsnagErrorHandlerPlugin = () => { // init bugsnag return { fn: { componentDidCatch = (error, info) => { Bugsnag.notify(error); Bugsnag.notify(info); }, }, }; }; {% endhighlight %} withErrorBoundary This function is HOC (Higher Order Component). It wraps a particular component into the ErrorBoundary component. It can be overridden via a plugin system to control how components are wrapped by the ErrorBoundary component. In 99.9% of situations, you won't need to override this function, but if you do, please read the source code of this function first. Fallback The component is displayed when the error boundary catches an error. It can be overridden via a plugin system. Its default implementation is trivial: import React from \"react\" import PropTypes from \"prop-types\" const Fallback = ({ name }) => ( <div className=\"fallback\"> \ud83d\ude31 <i>Could not render { name === \"t\" ? \"this component\" : name }, see the console.</i> </div> ) Fallback.propTypes = { name: PropTypes.string.isRequired, } export default Fallback Feel free to override it to match your look & feel: const CustomFallbackPlugin = () => ({ components: { Fallback: ({ name } ) => `This is my custom fallback. ${name} failed to render`, }, }); const swaggerUI = SwaggerUI({ url: \"https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json\", dom_id: '#swagger-ui', plugins: [ CustomFallbackPlugin, ] }); ErrorBoundary This is the component that implements React error boundaries. Uses componentDidCatch and Fallback under the hood. In 99.9% of situations, you won't need to override this component, but if you do, please read the source code of this component first. Change in behavior In prior releases of SwaggerUI (before v4.3.0), almost all components have been protected, and when thrown error, Fallback component was displayed. This changes with SwaggerUI v4.3.0. Only components defined by the safe-render plugin are now protected and display fallback. If a small component somewhere within SwaggerUI React component tree fails to render and throws an error.

If you're installing Swagger UI via NPM, for example, you can do this by using a tilde: { \"dependencies\": { \"swagger-ui\": \"~3.11.0\" } } Format A plugin return value may contain any of these keys, where stateKey is a name for a piece of state: { statePlugins: { [stateKey]: { actions, reducers, selectors, wrapActions, wrapSelectors } }, components: {}, wrapComponents: {}, rootInjects: {}, afterLoad: (system) => {}, fn: {}, } System is provided to plugins Let's assume we have a plugin, NormalPlugin , that exposes a doStuff action under the normal state namespace. const ExtendingPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { extending: { actions: { doExtendedThings: function(...args) { // you can do other things in here if you want return system.normalActions.doStuff(...args) } } } } } } As you can see, each plugin is passed a reference to the system being built up. As long as NormalPlugin is compiled before ExtendingPlugin , this will work without any issues. There is no dependency management built into the plugin system, so if you create a plugin that relies on another, it is your responsibility to make sure that the dependent plugin is loaded after the plugin being depended on. Interfaces Actions const MyActionPlugin = () => { return { statePlugins: { example: { actions: { updateFavoriteColor: (str) => { return { type: \"EXAMPLE_SET_FAV_COLOR\", payload: str } } } } } } } Once an action has been defined, you can use it anywhere that you can get a system reference: // elsewhere system.exampleActions.updateFavoriteColor(\"blue\") The Action interface enables the creation of new Redux action creators within a piece of state in the Swagger UI system. This action creator function will be exposed to container components as exampleActions.updateFavoriteColor . When this action creator is called, the return value (which should be a Flux Standard Action ) will be passed to the example reducer, which we'll define in the next section. For more information about the concept of actions in Redux, see the Redux Actions documentation . Reducers Reducers take a state (which is an Immutable.js map ) and an action, then returns a new state. Reducers must be provided to the system under the name of the action type that they handle, in this case, EXAMPLE_SET_FAV_COLOR . const MyReducerPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { example: { reducers: { \"EXAMPLE_SET_FAV_COLOR\": (state, action) => { // you're only working with the state under the namespace, in this case \"example\". // So you can do what you want, without worrying about /other/ namespaces return state.set(\"favColor\", action.payload) } } } } } } Selectors Selectors reach into their namespace's state to retrieve or derive data from the state. They're an easy way to keep logic in one place, and are preferred over passing state data directly into components. const MySelectorPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { example: { selectors: { myFavoriteColor: (state) => state.get(\"favColor\") } } } } } You can also use the Reselect library to memoize your selectors, which is recommended for any selectors that will see heavy use, since Reselect automatically memoizes selector calls for you: import { createSelector } from \"reselect\" const MySelectorPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { example: { selectors: { // this selector will be memoized after it is run once for a // value of `state` myFavoriteColor: createSelector((state) => state.get(\"favColor\")) } } } } } Once a selector has been defined, you can use it anywhere that you can get a system reference: system.exampleSelectors.myFavoriteColor() // gets `favColor` in state for you Components You can provide a map of components to be integrated into the system. Be mindful of the key names for the components you provide, as you'll need to use those names to refer to the components elsewhere. class HelloWorldClass extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello World!</h1> } } const MyComponentPlugin = function(system) { return { components: { HelloWorldClass: HelloWorldClass // components can just be functions, these are called \"stateless components\" HelloWorldStateless: () => <h1>Hello World!</h1>, } } } // elsewhere const HelloWorldStateless = system.getComponent(\"HelloWorldStateless\") const HelloWorldClass = system.getComponent(\"HelloWorldClass\") You can also \"cancel out\" any components that you don't want by creating a stateless component that always returns null : const NeverShowInfoPlugin = function(system) { return { components: { info: () => null } } } You can use config.failSilently if you don't want a warning when a component doesn't exist in the system. Be mindful of getComponent arguments order. In the example below, the boolean false refers to presence of a container, and the 3rd argument is the config object used to suppress the missing component warning. const thisVariableWillBeNull = getComponent(\"not_real\", false, { failSilently: true }) Wrap-Actions Wrap Actions allow you to override the behavior of an action in the system. They are function factories with the signature (oriAction, system) => (...args) => result . A Wrap Action's first argument is oriAction , which is the action being wrapped. It is your responsibility to call the oriAction - if you don't, the original action will not fire! This mechanism is useful for conditionally overriding built-in behaviors, or listening to actions. // FYI: in an actual Swagger UI, `updateSpec` is already defined in the core code // it's just here for clarity on what's behind the scenes const MySpecPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { spec: { actions: { updateSpec: (str) => { return { type: \"SPEC_UPDATE_SPEC\", payload: str } } } } } } } // this plugin allows you to watch changes to the spec that is in memory const MyWrapActionPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { spec: { wrapActions: { updateSpec: (oriAction, system) => (str) => { // here, you can hand the value to some function that exists outside of Swagger UI console.log(\"Here is my API definition\", str) return oriAction(str) // don't forget! otherwise, Swagger UI won't update } } } } } } Wrap-Selectors Wrap Selectors allow you to override the behavior of a selector in the system. They are function factories with the signature (oriSelector, system) => (state, ...args) => result . This interface is useful for controlling what data flows into components. We use this in the core code to disable selectors based on the API definition's version. import { createSelector } from 'reselect' // FYI: in an actual Swagger UI, the `url` spec selector is already defined // it's just here for clarity on what's behind the scenes const MySpecPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { spec: { selectors: { url: createSelector( state => state.get(\"url\") ) } } } } } const MyWrapSelectorsPlugin = function(system) { return { statePlugins: { spec: { wrapSelectors: { url: (oriSelector, system) => (state, ...args) => { console.log('someone asked for the spec url!!! it is', state.get('url')) // you can return other values here... // but let's just enable the default behavior return oriSelector(state, ...args) } } } } } } Wrap-Components Wrap Components allow you to override a component registered within the system. Wrap Components are function factories with the signature (OriginalComponent, system) => props => ReactElement . If you'd prefer to provide a React component class, (OriginalComponent, system) => ReactClass works as well. const MyWrapBuiltinComponentPlugin = function(system) { return { wrapComponents: { info: (Original, system) => (props) => { return <div> <h3>Hello world! I am above the Info component.</h3> <Original {...props} /> </div> } } } } Here's another example that includes a code sample of a component that will be wrapped: ///// Overriding a component from a plugin // Here's our normal, unmodified component. const MyNumberDisplayPlugin = function(system) { return { components: { NumberDisplay: ({ number }) => <span>{number}</span> } } } // Here's a component wrapper defined as a function. const MyWrapComponentPlugin = function(system) { return { wrapComponents: { NumberDisplay: (Original, system) => (props) => { if(props.number > 10) { return <div> <h3>Warning! Big number ahead.</h3> <Original {...props} /> </div> } else { return <Original {...props} /> } } } } } // Alternatively, here's the same component wrapper defined as a class. const MyWrapComponentPlugin = function(system) { return { wrapComponents: { NumberDisplay: (Original, system) => class WrappedNumberDisplay extends React.component { render() { if(props.number > 10) { return <div> <h3>Warning! Big number ahead.</h3> <Original {...props} /> </div> } else { return <Original {...props} /> } } } } } } rootInjects The rootInjects interface allows you to inject values at the top level of the system. This interface takes an object, which will be merged in with the top-level system object at runtime. const MyRootInjectsPlugin = function(system) { return { rootInjects: { myConstant: 123, myMethod: (...params) => console.log(...params) } } } afterLoad The afterLoad plugin method allows you to get a reference to the system after your plugin has been registered. This interface is used in the core code to attach methods that are driven by bound selectors or actions. You can also use it to execute logic that requires your plugin to already be ready, for example fetching initial data from a remote endpoint and passing it to an action your plugin creates. The plugin context, which is bound to this , is undocumented, but below is an example of how to attach a bound action as a top-level method: const MyMethodProvidingPlugin = function() { return { afterLoad(system) { // at this point in time, your actions have been bound into the system // so you can do things with them this.rootInjects = this.rootInjects || {} this.rootInjects.myMethod = system.exampleActions.updateFavoriteColor }, statePlugins: { example: { actions: { updateFavoriteColor: (str) => { return { type: \"EXAMPLE_SET_FAV_COLOR\", payload: str } } } } } } } fn The fn interface allows you to add helper functions to the system for use elsewhere. import leftPad from \"left-pad\" const MyFnPlugin = function(system) { return { fn: { leftPad: leftPad } } }","title":"Plugin API"},{"location":"swagger/swagger-ui-master/swagger-ui-master/docs/customization/plugin-api/#plugins","text":"A plugin is a function that returns an object - more specifically, the object may contain functions and components that augment and modify Swagger UI's functionality.","title":"Plugins"},{"location":"swagger/swagger-ui-master/swagger-ui-master/docs/customization/plugin-api/#note-semantic-versioning","text":"Swagger UI's internal APIs are not part of our public contract, which means that they can change without the major version change.

For readability, parameters are grouped by category and sorted alphabetically. Type notations are formatted like so: - String=\"\" means a String type with a default value of \"\" . - String=[\"a\"*, \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"] means a String type that can be a , b , c , or d , with the * indicating that a is the default value.

Controls whether the \"Try it out\" section should be enabled by default. requestSnippetsEnabled Unavailable Boolean=false . Enables the request snippet section. When disabled, the legacy curl snippet will be used. requestSnippets Unavailable Object={ generators: { curl_bash: { title: \"cURL (bash)\", syntax: \"bash\" }, curl_powershell: { title: \"cURL (PowerShell)\", syntax: \"powershell\" }, curl_cmd: { title: \"cURL (CMD)\", syntax: \"bash\" }, }, defaultExpanded: true, languages: null, // e.g. only show curl bash = [\"curl_bash\"] } This is the default configuration section for the requestSnippets plugin. Network Parameter name Docker variable Description oauth2RedirectUrl OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URL String . OAuth redirect URL. requestInterceptor Unavailable Function=(a => a) . MUST be a function. Function to intercept remote definition, \"Try it out\", and OAuth 2.0 requests. Accepts one argument requestInterceptor(request) and must return the modified request, or a Promise that resolves to the modified request. request.curlOptions Unavailable Array . If set, MUST be an array of command line options available to the curl command. This can be set on the mutated request in the requestInterceptor function. For example request.curlOptions = [\"-g\", \"--limit-rate 20k\"] responseInterceptor Unavailable Function=(a => a) . MUST be a function. Function to intercept remote definition, \"Try it out\", and OAuth 2.0 responses. Accepts one argument responseInterceptor(response) and must return the modified response, or a Promise that resolves to the modified response. showMutatedRequest SHOW_MUTATED_REQUEST Boolean=true . If set to true , uses the mutated request returned from a requestInterceptor to produce the curl command in the UI, otherwise the request before the requestInterceptor was applied is used. supportedSubmitMethods SUPPORTED_SUBMIT_METHODS Array=[\"get\", \"put\", \"post\", \"delete\", \"options\", \"head\", \"patch\", \"trace\"] . List of HTTP methods that have the \"Try it out\" feature enabled. An empty array disables \"Try it out\" for all operations. This does not filter the operations from the display. validatorUrl VALIDATOR_URL String=\"https://validator.swagger.io/validator\" OR null . By default, Swagger UI attempts to validate specs against swagger.io's online validator. You can use this parameter to set a different validator URL, for example for locally deployed validators ( Validator Badge ). Setting it to either none , 127.0.0.1 or localhost will disable validation. withCredentials WITH_CREDENTIALS Boolean=false If set to true , enables passing credentials, as defined in the Fetch standard , in CORS requests that are sent by the browser. Note that Swagger UI cannot currently set cookies cross-domain (see swagger-js#1163 ) - as a result, you will have to rely on browser-supplied cookies (which this setting enables sending) that Swagger UI cannot control.

Most browsers + JavaScript toolkits not only support CORS but enforce it, which has implications for your API server which supports Swagger. You can read about CORS here: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors. There are two cases where no action is needed for CORS support: Swagger UI is hosted on the same server as the application itself (same host and port). The application is located behind a proxy that enables the required CORS headers. This may already be covered within your organization. Otherwise, CORS support needs to be enabled for: Your Swagger docs. For Swagger 2.0 it's the swagger.json / swagger.yaml and any externally $ref ed docs. For the Try it now button to work, CORS needs to be enabled on your API endpoints as well. Testing CORS Support You can verify CORS support with one of three techniques: Curl your API and inspect the headers. For instance: $ curl -I \"https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json\" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2015 23:05:44 GMT Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, api_key, Authorization Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 0 This tells us that the petstore resource listing supports OPTIONS, and the following headers: Content-Type , api_key , Authorization .

Here's an example: import SwaggerUI from 'swagger-ui' // or use require if you prefer const SwaggerUI = require('swagger-ui') SwaggerUI({ dom_id: '#myDomId' }) See the Webpack Getting Started sample for details. In contrast, swagger-ui-dist is meant for server-side projects that need assets to serve to clients. The module, when imported, includes an absolutePath helper function that returns the absolute filesystem path to where the swagger-ui-dist module is installed. Note: we suggest using swagger-ui when your tooling makes it possible, as swagger-ui-dist will result in more code going across the wire. The module's contents mirror the dist folder you see in the Git repository. The most useful file is swagger-ui-bundle.js , which is a build of Swagger UI that includes all the code it needs to run in one file. The folder also has an index.html asset, to make it easy to serve Swagger UI like so: const express = require('express') const pathToSwaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-dist').absolutePath() const app = express() app.use(express.static(pathToSwaggerUi)) app.listen(3000) The module also exports SwaggerUIBundle and SwaggerUIStandalonePreset , so if you're in a JavaScript project that can't handle a traditional npm module, you could do something like this: var SwaggerUIBundle = require('swagger-ui-dist').SwaggerUIBundle const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({ url: \"https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json\", dom_id: '#swagger-ui', presets: [ SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis, SwaggerUIBundle.SwaggerUIStandalonePreset ], layout: \"StandaloneLayout\" }) SwaggerUIBundle is equivalent to SwaggerUI . Docker You can pull a pre-built docker image of the swagger-ui directly from Docker Hub: docker pull swaggerapi/swagger-ui docker run -p 80:8080 swaggerapi/swagger-ui Will start nginx with Swagger UI on port 80. Or you can provide your own swagger.json on your host docker run -p 80:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/foo/swagger.json -v /bar:/foo swaggerapi/swagger-ui You can also provide a URL to a swagger.json on an external host: docker run -p 80:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON_URL=https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json swaggerapi/swagger-ui The base URL of the web application can be changed by specifying the BASE_URL environment variable: docker run -p 80:8080 -e BASE_URL=/swagger -e SWAGGER_JSON=/foo/swagger.json -v /bar:/foo swaggerapi/swagger-ui This will serve Swagger UI at /swagger instead of / . You can specify a different port via PORT variable for accessing the application, default is 8080 . docker run -p 80:80 -e PORT=80 swaggerapi/swagger-ui You can specify an IPv6 port via PORT_IPV6 variable. By default, IPv6 port is not set. docker run -p 80:80 -e PORT_IPV6=8080 swaggerapi/swagger-ui You can allow/disallow embedding via EMBEDDING variable. By default, embedding is disabled. docker run -p 80:80 -e EMBEDDING=true swaggerapi/swagger-ui For more information on controlling Swagger UI through the Docker image, see the Docker section of the Configuration documentation . unpkg You can embed Swagger UI's code directly in your HTML by using unpkg's interface: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <meta name=\"description\" content=\"SwaggerUI\" /> <title>SwaggerUI</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@5.11.0/swagger-ui.css\" /> </head> <body> <div id=\"swagger-ui\"></div> <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@5.11.0/swagger-ui-bundle.js\" crossorigin></script> <script> window.onload = () => { window.ui = SwaggerUIBundle({ url: 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json', dom_id: '#swagger-ui', }); }; </script> </body> </html> Using StandalonePreset will render TopBar and ValidatorBadge as well. <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <meta name=\"description\" content=\"SwaggerUI\" /> <title>SwaggerUI</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@5.11.0/swagger-ui.css\" /> </head> <body> <div id=\"swagger-ui\"></div> <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@5.11.0/swagger-ui-bundle.js\" crossorigin></script> <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@5.11.0/swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js\" crossorigin></script> <script> window.onload = () => { window.ui = SwaggerUIBundle({ url: 'https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json', dom_id: '#swagger-ui', presets: [ SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis, SwaggerUIStandalonePreset ], layout: \"StandaloneLayout\", }); }; </script> </body> </html> See unpkg's main page for more information on how to use unpkg.
